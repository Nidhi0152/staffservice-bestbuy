# BestBuy Staff-Service Microservice
Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nidhi0152/bestbuy-staffservice/tags
##  Overview

The **Staff-Service** microservice is part of the BestBuy Cloud-Native Application. It is a lightweight RESTful service that provides basic CRUD operations for managing staff information. This service adheres to the 12-factor app principles and is containerized for deployment to a Kubernetes environment on Azure AKS.

All data is stored in memory, making it simple and ideal for demonstration or testing purposes.

- Create a new staff member

- Delete a staff record

Each staff member record contains:
